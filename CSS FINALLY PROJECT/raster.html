        <h1>PHOTOSHOP</h1>

		
		<p>This is the first project that  I did for the class. The idea of this design is there have another you that are living in the other universe, but you did not know about it.  I like to work with photoshop software. One thing that I like photoshop the most is it can make the different elements to separate, it is called "layer".
